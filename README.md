# product_app

 In this project, I developed a product shop application using Flutter. The app follows a clean and modular
 architecture, utilizing BLoC for state management, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. I
 used Dio for efficient API requests, and the app is capable of local data storage using Shared Preferences.
 The project also incorporates JSON serialization for parsing data, with Lottie animations providing a
 smooth and engaging user experience. The application is fully internationalized, utilizing Flutter
 Localizations and Intl for multilingual support
